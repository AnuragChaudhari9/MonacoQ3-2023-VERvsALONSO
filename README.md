Monaco 2023 Qualifier was probably the most dramatic session in Formula 1, in recent times. Fernando Alonso, one of the GOAT in F1 had a good chance of bagging pole position after a decade; 10 years (3,976 days) and 162 races to be precise! <br/>
His Q3 lap time of 1:11.449 would have been pole-worthy in most other years. But this day, he finished just 0.084s behind the magical Max Verstappen. 0.084s!! <br/>
Just to put things in perspective as to how tight this session was, P3 placed Ferrari of Charles Leclerc missed pole by just 0.106s and P2 by 0.022s.

## Monaco Grand Prix 
First introduced in F1 in 1929, this legendary track is notorious for being technically challenging due to its narrow width and insanely tight curves. ![monaco_track](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/061c9695-f624-408f-89e3-2b554ceb7e7c)<br/>
Here, not only do you need to be fast, but also sharp in turning. This is where Verstappen and Alonso differed. Redbull was obviously the faster car compared to Ashton Martin of Alonso, especially on straights. However, that day Max was facing lots of issues with slow speed grip.

## Q3 2023

If you compare the plots of VER vs ALONSO, we can see Alonso was much more aggressive on the throttle than Verstappen. He was late on lifting the throttle, which worked in his favour in Sector 1 and Sector 2. He was 0.137s ahead of Verstappen after S2.
But on a punishing track such as Monaco, this might have led to him having to break harder and compromise his entries into T12 and T13. This meant he carried lower speeds than Verstappen through these corners and had lower exit speeds as well. This can be seen in the Speed Plot. <br/>
Verstappen brushed the walls in S3, showcasing millimetre accuracy, and was finally able to gain 0.221 seconds in the shortest sector of the map! Truly this was the most legendary Q3s of all time in F1.
